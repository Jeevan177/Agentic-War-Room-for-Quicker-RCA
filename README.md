# 🚀 Agentic War Room for Quicker RCA

## 📌 Overview  
The **Agentic War Room for Quicker Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** is an AI-powered system designed to classify issues, predict root causes, and provide quick solutions using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The system utilizes **DistilBERT** for issue classification, ensuring faster and more accurate problem resolution.

## 🎯 Key Features  
✅ **Automated RCA** – Classifies issues and predicts root causes using DistilBERT.  
✅ **Streamlit UI** – Interactive web app for issue selection and analysis.  
✅ **Pre-trained Models** – Uses **DistilBERT** for NLP-based analysis.  
✅ **Efficient Search** – FAISS for fast similarity matching (future enhancement).  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Python** (PyTorch, Transformers, Pandas)  
- **Hugging Face Models**: DistilBERT  
- **Streamlit** (for interactive UI)  
- **FAISS** (for similarity search)  
- **Torch & Transformers** (for deep learning models)  

## 📂 Project Structure
